def test_concurrent_access_conceptual():
    """Conceptual test for concurrent access. Requires proper threading/multiprocessing setup."""
    # This test is a placeholder to acknowledge the need for concurrent access testing.
    # Actual concurrent access testing would involve:
    # 1. Creating multiple threads or processes.
    # 2. Each thread/process attempting to create DTOs concurrently.
    # 3. Asserting consistency and lack of race conditions or deadlocks.

    # Example (conceptual, not fully implemented for execution):
    # def create_dto_in_thread(thread_id):
    #     class ThreadSafeUserDTO(DTO[User]):
    #         config = DTOConfig(model_name=f"ThreadSafeUserDTO_{thread_id}")
    #     instance = ThreadSafeUserDTO(
    #         id=thread_id,
    #         name=f"User_{thread_id}",
    #         age=25,
    #         is_active=True,
    #         created_at="2023-01-01T10:00:00",
    #         registered_on="2023-01-01",
    #         last_login="10:00:00",
    #         balance=100.0,
    #         rating=4.5,
    #     )
    #     assert instance.id == thread_id

    # threads = []
    # for i in range(10):
    #     thread = threading.Thread(target=create_dto_in_thread, args=(i,))
    #     threads.append(thread)
    #     thread.start()

    # for thread in threads:
    #     thread.join()

    # For now, we will just ensure the DTO creation process itself is not inherently broken
    # by a single, sequential creation.

        config = DTOConfig(model_name="SimpleUserDTO")
